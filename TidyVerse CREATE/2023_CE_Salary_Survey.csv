I have a minimum invoice amount I need to hit each month (2.25x my salary averaged over 6 months) to receive my full salary, and then anything extra I'll get topped off with a bonus check every 6 months to hit that 40%. So I determine what I earn. With that, my boss has given me unlimited PTO with the only requirement of me needing to hit my minimum invoicing each month which is easily attainable.

The company has a weird vibe to it (a little too religious for my liking, small firms in Utah have a LOT of religious folks that have no boundaries), but the pay is good enough that I'll stick around for the foreseeable future, at least for the next 2-3 years.

I work from home about 4-5 days per week, but I head into the office once or twice per week for 4 hours or so to make an appearance. The computer I use at home is far more powerful than my work computer and I purchased the home computer with my own money. My boss used to be a little hesitant to let me work from home, but now that he's seen that my numbers are still good months later he has no issues with me working from home as much as I do.

I don't think he's happy that I'm only working 25-30 hours per week and would prefer I work more, but since I'm hitting our agreed upon numbers he won't make any changes. He's getting paid for me to be happy at home.",Male,0,
